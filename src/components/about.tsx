        Hey! This is Garvit Singhal, a passionate and dedicated third‑year
        engineering student at SKIT, Jaipur, with a strong interest in web
        development. My journey into the world of technology began with a simple
        curiosity — understanding how websites work — which gradually led me to
        explore the depths of backend development. Currently, I’m honing my
        skills in Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, focusing on building robust and
        efficient web applications. I find great joy in turning ideas into
        interactive, user-friendly digital experiences.
